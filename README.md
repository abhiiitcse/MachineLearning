# Machine Learning Course from Coursera
This repository consist of assignments of Machine learning course from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/). Programming language used for these assignments are implemented in [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). However source codes can be executed on Matlab. Synatx for matlab and Octave are almost same.

## Programming Assignment - 1
This assignment consist of implementation of Linear regression on data. 


```Source code
ex1.m file contain the implementation of assignment evaluation script. 
It calls other script and displays implementation of different modules.
```

**1. warmUpExercise.m**
	- Generates identity matrix of size 5. <br/>

**1. plotData.m**
	- Plot input data to visualize the structure that might help in modelling the parameters. This scripts read data from file and plot input feature against output value.
